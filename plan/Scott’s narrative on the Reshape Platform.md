**Scott’s narrative on the Reshape Platform.**

0:00: Hey, Sammy, the platform's mint.   
 0:03: I, I think, I've just gone through in my head what maybe what the narrative for that section of the session might be and, how we might use the platform to compellingly kind of, I guess, close the loop.   
 0:16: And, and in my mind, we've gone through the themes in the blueprint.   
 0:19: We've, we've had a conversation about, you know, building a programme of work around clients and one in particular, and that this, this is sort of, what does all that mean to the commit for the commercial aspect of the business, I think we would, we will obviously acknowledge that we've started with media because that's where Nick's sort of focal point appears to be, but This tool would be relevant and usable for every function and agency.   
 0:45: and, and I think in the fullness of time, i, when it launches, it would be, it would enable you to, you know, do this for every, every function in the business.   
 0:53: So, I think that's the first caveat that you'd, you'd acknowledge and then Then I think you'd, we'd go through and say, so what we've done in 2 days is we've taken some information that Nicky and Blair have given us, and we've built, we've, we've ingested 25 job descriptions, the org chart of 45 roles.   
 1:12: , and taken some feedback from Blair and Nicky around.   
 1:16: , The allocation of like how task heavy specific roles are.   
 1:23: One of the things in the blueprints is that O-shaped thinkers will, will drive the future of agency talent and, and roles and people that are just responsible for a collection of tasks, tasks will become obsolete.   
 1:35: So, a bunch of inputs.   
 1:38: So, you know, what are those, what are those, I guess, contributors to a, a, a task score inside a role and how critical or how, how normal it is, are things like, is the technology available to, to replace this role or do this task.   
 1:53: , having a bit of a chat about some of those inputs into the algorithm, I think would be useful because it builds credibility.   
 1:59: But effectively, we go, look, we've ingested the JD's, we've ingested your old chart.   
 2:03: We've taken a bunch of feedback from Blair and the team about roles.   
 2:08: And what that will enable you to do is sit there and go, OK, if, if Adrian's mandate is, I want to take 50 million bucks out of Omnicom, or if Paul's mandate is I want to take 20% of my headcount out of the agency by the end of 2026, this tool will give you the ability to Plan for that, and that you can organise role susceptibility based on time frame horizons, what's currently available, what might be available tomorrow, all of those good things, and it can start to build a really, really robust kind of point of view on a roadmap for cost out.   
 2:41: So that in and of itself is really valuable.   
 2:43: The thing that gets super exciting is that, and, and this is the point where you go.   
 2:48: Commercial momentum is, which is what this part of the, the conversation is about, is actually about, it's obviously about removing cost from the business and friction from the business.   
 2:59: But it's, it's also, it has to be.   
 3:02: Combined with a programme of cultural momentum and change management.   
 3:06: And so, you can't just take money out, rolls out, because, you know, you'll drop the ball and relationships will suffer and all those good things.   
 3:12: So, we can connect a time frame horizon plan around how you take roles and costs out of the business with The AI strategy and roadmap perhaps tooling upskilling, that change management programme in general and build out a, a really, really kind of clever strategically driven roadmap for, for achieving this commercial momentum that everyone's so desperate to kind of understand.   
 3:37: so, as a tool it it presents a really, really big opportunity to To help you on your journey to, you know, delivering the change that you require.   
 3:49: That to me is kind of the narrative, I think that.   
 3:55: Might help close the loop.   
 3:56: So it's, it's, It's functionally very useful.   
 4:02: It's technically connected to a bunch of the thinking that we've already done around the themes and the roadmap that we believe will enable those themes to be realised.   
 4:10: And, and there's a commercial metric kind of modelling.   
 4:14: That sits alongside it, that allows agency leaders to to plan and build confidence around financial outcomes and ultimately, that's what Nick wants.   
 4:22: So, it's, it's great.   
 4:23: And I guess that narrative to me would be a great way to close the session and go, you know, we'll share the blueprint with you.   
 4:30: You can have a read, challenge any of the thinking.   
 4:33: we, we, with your blessing, we want to build, we want to take those themes and George's ambition and build this model that allows Omnicom or McCann NZ to be with one NZ the The agency of the future and in the process we can build a commercial model that supports all of that, that allows us to have really robust conversations with your boss, Nick, and And you know, PW's boss and Jason Parris effectively around, around what the
